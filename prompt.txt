Generate the task tree for the given dish in the input content file by utilizing the 'input.json' provided for menu items and the 'kitchen.txt' for available ingredients and equipment.
Make that there are input, motion, and output nodes in every job tree. 
The nodes ought to depict the entire process of making every dish, including all required phases including ingredient preparation, cooking, and final assembly.
Initial circumstances and elements that are available should be listed in the input nodes; particular actions conducted during preparation should be described in the motion nodes; and changes and final states following each action should be detailed in the output nodes. 
Verify that all procedures are followed and that the equipment and ingredients are available from the input files.
